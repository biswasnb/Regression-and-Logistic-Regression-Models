# Regression and Logistic Regression Models

## Overview
This repository demonstrates the application of both regression and classification models on two datasets:
1. **Part A**: Simple, Multiple Linear Regression on the `50_Startups.csv` dataset and Polynomial Linear Regression on the `Position_Salaries.csv` dataset. The focus is on data preprocessing, model training, and visualization of the results.
2. **Part B**: Logistic Regression model to predict university admission based on GRE score, GPA, and institution prestige, evaluated using Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Accuracy.
